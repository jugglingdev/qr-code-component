## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This was my very first coding project built from scratch without the aid of a tutorial (hurray!).

After reviewing the style guide and design images, I first coded the HTML and then the CSS.  Had this project called for responsive design, I would have followed the best practice of styling for mobile first and then desktop.

Due to the simplicity of the design, I chose to not use Flexbox and instead mapped out a simple box model.  I also changed the `img` display to `block` instead of the default `inline` to make centering easier.

The style guide called for the `Outfit` font family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit).  This was fairly easy to set up since it is externally hosted.  It was also rewarding to see the font change!

Wanting to work on my semantic HTML, I separated the attribution from the `card div` as a `footer`.

My favorite part of this exercise was working with link pseudo-classes.  I had fun selecting font colors that would complement the existing colors in the design for the `:hover`, `:active`, and `:visited` pseudo-classes.

Outside of what was given in the style guide, I did my best to match the margin, padding, and line-height of the design images.

Overall, it was a good first challenge with [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).  Nice and simple, but definitely a great first step to get me thinking from scratch.

### Continued development

I did not use Flexbox or advanced positioning for this project, so that is something I would like to practice in a future project to hone in on my HTML and CSS skills.

This project did not call for responsive design either, which is something else I would like to practice more in the future.  For instance, I would like to work with a project that utilizes `@media` queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
